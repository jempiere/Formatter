# Formatter
A simple class for simple formatting. See the docs for more details at https://jempiere.github.io/Formatter/.


## Abilities


the Formatter class has several methods that allow the user to reformat strings by appending, prepending, replacing, case-changing, and separating -- all within a String full of commands. The method returns a String with the commands enacted.
The commands are available in the formatter(String data, String format) method of the javadoc, and eventually an option will be added to append self-made functionality. Happy Coding!
